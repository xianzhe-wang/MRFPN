# MRFPN-for-BREAST-MASS-DETECTION (MRBMDNet)

The entire code is written based on mmdetection, so the basic environment of mmdetection needs to be built first.

1: Copy the file to the .../mmdetection/mmdet/models/necks/

2: Register the MHFPN module name in the .../mmdetection/mmdet/models/necks/init.py

3: Reinstall mmdet

4: Modify the name of the FPN module in the config file (ie MRBMDNet).
